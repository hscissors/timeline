Timeline
========

Just a few notes on things I would change about the application if I had more time to reforactor:

<ul>
	<li>Seperate out the rather clunky "modes" in the activities into fragments to keep the code more readable. As it stands now, it's a little confusing.</li>
	<li>Major renaming of the "Groups," which are actually "Timelines."</li>
	<li>enum the statics from Constants into the classes they are most closely related to.</li>
	<li>Refactor the "select mode" to take advantage of the ActionBars select more.</li>
</ul>
